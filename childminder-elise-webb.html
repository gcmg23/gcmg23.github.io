        Getting creative is my favourite activity and the kids too! We have various paints, play dough, pens, chalks, coloured papers, and sticky glue to get busy with and find our inner Picasso! A sunny south facing garden is the place to be, with mature trees and shrubs, it’s a fantastic place, for children to play. Children love the outdoors, so we are often out exploring and having fun in all weathers going to various parks, Belton house, Little Jacks farm, swimming etc.<br><br>
        
        Being able to provide a home from home service for parents is important and a profession I find truly rewarding. I look forward to welcoming your children into my care Visits welcome, references available.</p>

          <h2><a name="experience">My experience</a></h2>
        <p> As a qualified Nursery Nurse, NNEB, I have spent over 30 years working with children of various ages and needs from birth to 16+ and have found all my roles and experiences rewarding and full of fun. I have a natural affinity with children and truly enjoy their company, encouraging and supporting them to achieve and acquire new skills and intrests so they can become independent individuals.<br><br>
I am a mum of 3, adults now, a grandma, I have been a family nanny and worked in a day care nursery as an officer in charge. I have worked in primary and secondary schools supporting children with speech and language difficulties, emotional and behavioural needs and have experience of children with ADHD, global delay and autism.<br><br>
