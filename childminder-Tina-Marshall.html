          <h2><a name="experience">Other Information</a></h2>
        <p>I work with my husband, who is also an OFSTED Registered Childminder. All the children will be welcomed into my family as one of my own, and will be treated as such, but, I will never attempt to take your role. <br><br>The premises in which your child will be cared for in is a semi-detached house, close to the town centre and amenities, the interior of my home, provides a playroom with a large variety of toys, games, books etc, a television and computer. There is a large kitchen and dinning room for meals to be eaten in, crafts and messy play. A toilet downstairs. <br><br>Access is kept to the downstairs whilst childminding, unless children require a sleep, then there is a bedroom upstairs for them. All the windows are securely locked and safe. There is a large, fully enclosed garden with a locked gate. There are lots of toys outside for the children to play with and for various ages and development. The environment is homely, and I provide your child with the same care and attention that you would provide yourself. </p>
