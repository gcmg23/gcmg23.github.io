          <h2><a name="experience">Other Information</a></h2>
        <p>On my last inspection I was graded Outstanding in all areas. I live with my hushband and 3 children aged 7, 21 and 24. I have been a registered childminder for 18 years. Everyone holds an enhanced disclosure certifcates. I have worked in childcare for over 30 years, in nurseries or as a private nanny. <br><br> I have spaces for children 6 weeks - 11 years. I believe children learn through play and following the EYFS to help all children in my care reach their full potential. During the week we go out to Toddler groups, Library, music groups, Belton house, Diddy Dancers, local parks, farms and Nature trails. At home we do play doh,crafts, singing and dancing, story`s, games and puzzles, den building, messy play and outdoor play in our enclosed garden with mud kitchen, play house, sand, water play, pushchairs, bikes and ride on toys.  </p>
