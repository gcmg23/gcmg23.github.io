          <h2><a name="experience">Other Information</a></h2>
        <p>I have a large playroom with a wide variety of resources and imaginative toys such as cars and garage, mini kitchen, market stall, construction toys such as duplo and stickle bricks. The children will be able to enjoy lots of sensory, messy play activities as well such as gloop, playdough, painting and sticking, as well as playing outside in the sand and water, on ride on cars and trikes etc. We regularly go on walks and visit local playgroups, libraries and parks as well as places such as Belton house to explore nature and play on the large equipment and enjoy a picnic.<br><br>
        
        I will provide healthy snacks, morning and afternoon such as fruit, vegetable sticks, cheese and crackers, yogurts etc and drinks will be available at all times.<br><br>
            
        I have worked in childcare for 20 years now in a variety of settings from nurseries, to a teaching assistant at a local infant school to becoming a childminder.<br><br>
            
        I am passionate about providing children with the best possible start to life and all minded children will be given the same care and respect and affection as my own children.<br><br>
