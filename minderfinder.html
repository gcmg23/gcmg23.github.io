            <p>Location: Barrowby Gate, Grantham</p>
            <p>About: My approach to childminding is one that I hope shows the specialism and professionalism that a nursery provides but with a more personal and loving approach a child can only receive in a home to home environment. The mornings a child spends within my care will tend to be quite active and will involve being out and about visiting places of interest, play areas or groups or other childminding colleagues and socialising with their children. The afternoons will tend to be more relaxed and spent usually within my home with an element of educational and developmental activities.</p>
