            <p id="childminder-int">My aim is to offer caring, stimulating and flexible childcare. For a child to develop well they require an environment that offers a wide range of learning activities that are relevant to their age and stage of learning.</p>

        <h2>Hullabaloo Childminding</h2>   
        <p id="childminder-int">I will help your child develop confidence and independence by: being kind, Respecting their background, Encouraging and praising them, Valuing them and encouraging them to try new experiences.<br><br>
I offer a wide range of toys both indoor and outdoor. We have a playroom filled with books , games , imaginative toys ie ; train track, farm, dolls, home role play. Puppets, dressing up, construction toys such as wooden blocks, sewing beads and duplo.  I offer creative , messy play with painting, junk modelling, playdough, gloop and drawing. I believe a child will learn better through thoughtful and well planned resources, and activities. And above all we have FUN !<br><br>
Outside we have a decking area and a lawn with sit on toys, children are encouraged to bring inside toys outside. We have sand and water play also.<br><br>
We enjoy outings to structured groups held at the Childrens centre, Belton House for picnics and play on the large equipment, the library and park. We also make regular visits to Little jacks farm to feed the various animals.<br><br>
All children have access to drinks at all times ; parents can provide their own if they wish.<br><br>
Healthy fruit snacks are provided mid morning and mid afternoon eg kiwi, apples , pear, banana, melon, cheese, cucumber etc.<br><br>
All children eat at the table, good manners are encouraged at all times.<br><br>
I thoroughly enjoy my job and childminding has become a big part of our family life, all minded children are given the same respect and affection as my own children.<br><br>
I enjoy being part of the childrens lifes and to see them grow into confident and independent young people. I have been fortunate to have long term relationships with all of my families, and I look forward to many more enjoyable and rewarding years !
