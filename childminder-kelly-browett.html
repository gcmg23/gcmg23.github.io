        <p id="childminder-int">Ofsted rated, Outstanding (2015). I am a friendly caring childminder with a NNEB qualification.  I am passionate about providing every child in my care with a fun, stimulating and safe environment to play and learn. With my wealth of experience gained in all aspects of childcare at all levels through to management.
This enables my childminding service to give children and parents an excellent, flexible child care solution. My aim is to work in partnership with parents to provide a ‘home from home’ flexible childcare option. My whole ethos encompasses fun and exciting activities to assist in providing early years foundation stage provision (EYFS).
