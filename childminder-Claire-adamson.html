        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>   
        <p id="childminder-int">My aim is to support your child`s learning and development by providing outstanding care, enriching learning opportunities and engaging play experiences that support the holistic development of each child. I will provide a warm, caring and trusting enviroment with the Early Years Foundation Stage, where your child will feel safe and secure for them to explore and learn. As a parent, I know how difficult it can be to leave your child in someone else`s care. That`s why at Happy Tots, Im not just here to support the child but also the parents so you feel happy and secure leaving your child at my setting. Happy Tots Childminding is a place where little hearts feel safe, little minds are inspired and every child is given time and care they deserve. </p>

          <h2><a name="experience">Other Information</a></h2>
        <p>I am an OFSTED registered childminder with over 11 years of experience working in a primary school as a teaching assistant, working mainly in EYFS and KS1 classes. I have also worked in KS2 and volunteered at a nursery. Working in a school has given me a deep understanding of the EYFS Statutory Framework, from tracking development milestones to planning engaging, play- based learning activities. My time as a TA has taught me that every play session is a learning opportunity. Whether we're exploring sensory bins or reading stories, I'm using my professional training to observe, assess and plan for your child's next steps - so they can be school ready!

I work Monday to Friday 7.30am- 5.30pm and I have spaces for children aged 6 weeks to 11 years. I also accept Free Childcare for Working Parents Government funding. During the week we will go on fun filled adventures to explore the outdoors, for example trips to Belton House, farms, nature trails, toddler groups, local library and many more! <br><br>The premises in which your child will be cared for in is a semi-detached house, close to the town centre and amenities, the interior of my home, provides a playroom with a large variety of toys, games, books etc, a television and computer. There is a large kitchen and dinning room for meals to be eaten in, crafts and messy play. A toilet downstairs. <br><br>Access is kept to the downstairs whilst childminding, unless children require a sleep, then there is a bedroom upstairs for them. All the windows are securely locked and safe. There is a large, fully enclosed garden with a locked gate. There are lots of toys outside for the children to play with and for various ages and development. The environment is homely, and I provide your child with the same care and attention that you would provide yourself. </p>
