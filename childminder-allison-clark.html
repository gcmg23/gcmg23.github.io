        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>   
        <p id="childminder-int">My aim is to provide all the children in my care with a safe and caring environment. I want all the children to feel comfortable, so that they can play and learn at their own pace. They will be encouraged to let their independence grow, but at the same time they will become an important member of a group. They will be meeting new friends. All children will be treated as individuals and with equal concern, respect for self, others and the environment will be emphasised, I will help them learn about their own cultures as well as developing positive attitude towards people who are different from themselves. At all times, the welfare and protection of the children is my priority, but my main priority is to have FUN!</p>

          <h2><a name="experience">Other Information</a></h2>
        <p>I work with my husband, who is also an OFSTED Registered Childminder. All the children will be welcomed into my family as one of my own, and will be treated as such, but, I will never attempt to take your role. <br><br>The premises in which your child will be cared for in is a semi-detached house, close to the town centre and amenities, the interior of my home, provides a playroom with a large variety of toys, games, books etc, a television and computer. There is a large kitchen and dinning room for meals to be eaten in, crafts and messy play. A toilet downstairs. <br><br>Access is kept to the downstairs whilst childminding, unless children require a sleep, then there is a bedroom upstairs for them. All the windows are securely locked and safe. There is a large, fully enclosed garden with a locked gate. There are lots of toys outside for the children to play with and for various ages and development. The environment is homely, and I provide your child with the same care and attention that you would provide yourself. </p>
