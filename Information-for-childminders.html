            <h1>Information for childminders</h1>
            <p>Grantham Childminding Group was set up in the spring of 2004 in order for childminders to have a base of support in their local area. We vary in ages and experience which is what makes our group great, as we all support each other and can share experiences so we are not isolated. Some have been childminding for 30+ years! <br><br>
            We meet up once a week so that we, and the children we care for, can have some social time. During these times we play, chat and do activities with the children. 
</p>
            <!--
            <p>The childminding group is a great opportunity to network and make some super friends. We have many social events through out the year some during working hours with many exciting events for the children and some out of hours fun aswell!</p> -->
