        <p id="childminder-int">My approach to childminding is one that I hope shows the specialism and professionalism that a nursery provides but with a more personal and loving approach a child can only receive in a home to home environment. The mornings a child spends within my care will tend to be quite active and will involve being out and about visiting places of interest, play areas or groups or other childminding colleagues and socialising with their children. The afternoons will tend to be more relaxed and spent usually within my home with an element of educational and developmental activities. I will love and care for your child as I would my own children and provide them with the security and trust they would receive in their own home. I hope this is what you are looking for in a childminder and my husband Ian and I look forward to meeting with you and discussing your childcare requirements further and maybe even to eventually look after your precious little one(s)… </p>

          <h2><a name="experience">Other Information</a></h2>
        <p>I am mum to two sons, Neo born August 2010 and Casper born February 2013. I am also wife to Ian and we have been together since 2000 and married since 2005. I’ve had an extremely full on career within sales and marketing since graduating from University in 1996 and when I had Neo back in 2010 I decided that I didn’t want the stressful, hectic lifestyle I had so far enjoyed, I wanted to worry less and enjoy life more and impart my vast experience to my son(s) and to other children if I could.
<br><br>
Childminding seemed the most logical step to take and I intend to specialise in being able to cater for children with special emotional needs such as autism, ADHD and other similar conditions and special needs as well as the standard fun loving childcare offering.
<br><br>
We are an active family, we love camping and caravanning and we have tents, a VW campervan and a tourer caravan. I adore working out and dancing and so combine this with regular step aerobics classes, yoga and swimming at my local gym. I also love cooking and good food and am a big fan of Annabel Karmel and the recipes she provides for children and babies.
<br><br>
We live in the Barrowby Gate area but I have my own transport and so I’m not limited in the areas I can consider for school/nursery pick ups or drop offs. I intend to provide all children within my care with a variety of activities, that include messy play, painting, model making, drawing, colouring, play dough etc. We have 2 netbook laptops which will be made available for IT related games, activities and developmental learning. A wide range of children’s television channels for quieter times when the children can learn to use the remote control, dvd player, cd player, etc. We have all types of role play toys such as a farm, campervans, tool boxes, shopping till and food. Card games such as Shopping List, Snap, Pairs, Go Fish and endless puzzles, jigsaws and other active games such as Elefun, Buckaroo, Jenga, etc. We have train sets, building blocks, shape sorters, interactive ABC cars and shape sorters and our outdoor selection includes, all sorts of ride alongs, walkers, scooters, balls, cricket, basketball, tennis, badminton, space hoppers, paddling pools etc. Your child will never be un-stimulated or bored within ‘Sam’s Seedlings’ home environment and I am there to help nurture and develop your child.<br><br>
