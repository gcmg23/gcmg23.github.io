            <p>Grantham Childminding Group was set up in the spring of 2004 in order for childminders to have a base of support in their local area. We now get together once or twice a week so that we, and the children that we care for, can have some social time. In these times we play, chat and do activities with the children. </p>

        <h3 id="about-expect-h3">What can I expect from a registered childminder?</h3>
        <p class="about-ppp">A happy home environment with the chance to get out and about in the community. Being cared for by a childminder gives youngsters the opportunity to learn from real life experiences. Everyday activities, like shopping trips, school runs, family mealtimes and visits to the park, teach children valuable life skills that they might not acquire so readily in centre-based care.</p>
    </div>     
        <h4>Out-of-school care</h4>
        <p class="about-pp">This unique age-integrated care provides enhanced learning opportunities and enables brothers and sisters of different ages to be looked after together, benefiting from a level of continuity unrivalled by any other form of childcare.</p>
        
        <h4>Collection and delivery to school or preschool</h4>
        <p class="about-pp">Flexible hours and often unsociable hours. Their flexibility makes childminders ideal care providers for children whose parents work shifts as, unlike most nurseries, childminders' homes are often open outside of standard office hours. Meals, drinks and snacks after school.</p>
        <h4>A lot of one to one or small group care.</h4> 
        <p class="about-pp">Because childminders look after small groups of children, their daily routine is very adaptable. Individual dietary requirements, sleeping patterns can be catered for with ease. And above all: A happy environment, a happy child and a happy family.</p>
