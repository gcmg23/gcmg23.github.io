        <p id="childminder-int">To provide a warm home from home environment full of love and care. Children will learn through play, gain confidence in what they can do independently ready for when they start school. As well as love, care and sharing with others. <br><br>
        I have moved to Grantham from London. I have worked with children for 14 years +. I also have my own two children boy and girl. We have a pet cat and the children enjoy learning how to care and be gentle with her.  <br><br>

I live in a cozy home with a good size garden the toilet is downstairs easily accessible to the children that need it. I have a good size garden that has a play house and mud kitchen with a few other toys.  
<br><br>
Children thrive with routine, I try to take the children out in the morning so they can socialise in bigger groups and can learn about the world they live in.  <br><br>

We all eat as a “family” around the kitchen table together. I also encourage naps and rest times in the afternoon.  <br><br>

The children will learn through play.  <br><br>

I can relay what the children have done at collection time but also use an online secure system to share with yourself photos of the children’s day to signing off accident reports. Ideal if someone other than main carer collects.
